Dotfiles for my dev environment.

Simply clone this repository into your `~/.config`.

## Dev Environment

### Setup

To setup the dev environment, run the following:

```shell
chmod -x dev-setup.sh
./dev-setup.sh
```

This will do the following:

1. Optionally setup symlinks for common config files (.gitconfig, .zshrc, etc)
2. Setup tooling for startship, neovim, and bat.
